\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

--convection moves plasma, should generate B fields

--where this occurs and why we care

--describe dynamo basics

--instabilities involved: describe MRI(?) and TS

--hope to show that TS is important \& gives dynamo

% Governing Equations
%=======================================================================
\subsection{Governing Equations}
\label{sec:eqn}

--cylind coords, compres navier-stokes, ideal-gas EOS

\begin{equation}
F=ma
\end{equation}

--background and fluctuations where flucts not small

--``linear LHS \& non-linear RHS'' see Appendix \ref{app:LHS_RHS}

\subsection{Numerical Method}
\label{sec:dedalus}

\dedalus\ is a low Mach number, multidimensional hydrodynamic code. It relies 
described in \cite{flames}.
