	Tayler-Spruit Dynamo Problem

	------------------------------------------------------------------

	Main questions:

		1) Does the TS dynamo operate & transport angular momentum?

		2) Does the TS dynamo close the loop?


	How to attack the questions:

		cylindrical coords, remove center
		full annulus, with R_inner=~0.3-0.5 & R_outer=1.0
		anelastic equation set (rotating, resistive MHD)
		z-axis goes for about 1 or less density scale heights
		probably want kappa/eta ~ 10 (thermal/magnetic)

	Analysis tools:

		use dedalus to do eigenmode/eigenfreq analysis
		look at angular momentum transport
